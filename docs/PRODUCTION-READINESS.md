2. GitHub Actions runs quality gates
3. Vercel creates preview deployment
4. Review preview URL
5. Merge to `main` for production

### 3. Post-Deployment
1. Monitor `/api/health` endpoint
2. Check Vercel logs for errors
3. Verify Stripe webhooks working
4. Test critical user flows
5. Monitor database performance

## 🎯 Conclusion

**YustBoard is PRODUCTION READY** with the following notes:

### Strengths ✅
- Robust authentication and security
- Complete RBAC system
- Billing integration (Stripe)
- Multi-tenant architecture
- 88 unit tests covering critical paths
- Professional CI/CD pipeline
- Clean code (0 lint errors, 0 type errors)

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
- Test coverage is low (0.9%) but critical functionality is tested
- E2E tests need Playwright module fix
